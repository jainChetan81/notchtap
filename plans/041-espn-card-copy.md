## Status

- **TODO** — filed 2026-07-19 from operator feedback watching ENG–FRA
  (World Cup) live on the new build.
- **Priority**: P3 · **Effort**: S · **Risk**: LOW (copy/formatting only,
  no `EventSignal`/wire/schema change — verified below).
- **Depends on**: none (037 already landed; 039 coordination is
  same-file-touch only, not a hard dependency — see gate above).
- **Review-plan pass 1 (2026-07-19)**: the original filing assumed the
  fix was uniformly mechanical across goal/penalty/own-goal/red-card.
  Reading the actual parsing code found it isn't: cards are **already**
  self-describing (`last_card` already prefixes with ESPN's own
  `detail_type.text`, e.g. "Yellow Card — B. Saka 54'") — only the
  scoring-play path (`last_scoring_play`) discards that same field.
  The real fix is narrower and more specific than the original Scope
  implied; this pass also found real fixture text ("Goal", "Penalty -
  Scored") to test against, found zero fixture coverage for "own goal"
  (planned as a synthesized test with a documented-best-guess label at
  the time), corrected `MatchState` → `ScoreUpdate` in the Scope
  description (goals are `ScoreUpdate`, not `MatchState`), and flagged
  the plan's emoji proposal as a style choice with zero precedent
  elsewhere in the codebase, not a given. A fresh-context subagent
  cold-read then caught a fixture-ordering bug in the Goal/Penalty test
  plan and a false premise that `baseline(UCL)` works — both fixed,
  with verified working test code (committed `15df3cc`).
- **Review-plan pass 2 (2026-07-20)**: reading the raw ESPN fixture JSON
  directly (not just the parsed Rust structs) found `ownGoal` and
  `penaltyKick` boolean fields on every scoring-play detail — structural
  signals `SbDetail` doesn't currently parse, sitting right next to
  `redCard` (which IS already parsed, for the exact same reason: "avoids
  text-matching... out of the composed detail_type.text",
  `poller.rs:90-91`). This eliminates the "documented best-guess" own-
  goal label entirely: Step 1 now adds `own_goal: bool` and derives the
  own-goal label from that structural fact, not from guessed text — see
  "Fixture evidence" and Step 2's own-goal test below, both rewritten.

## Problem

A live goal card renders title `fifa.world: ENG 1–0 FRA`, body
`D. Rice 3'`. The scoreline moving to 1–0 implies a goal, but the body
never says **what** the event was — operator "had to check what Declan
Rice did there." Nothing distinguishes a goal from a penalty or
own-goal — they'd all read as `<name> <minute>'`.

## Root cause (grounded, this review-plan pass)

Two sibling extraction blocks in `view()` (`poller.rs:180-266`) handle
this differently:

- **Cards already self-describe.** `last_card` (`poller.rs:229-247`)
  reads `d.detail_type.text` (ESPN's own play-type label — "Yellow
  Card", presumably "Red Card") and formats `"{kind} — {line}"`, e.g.
  `"Yellow Card — B. Saka 54'"` (`poller.rs:245`). This is already
  exactly the shape the operator wants for goals. **No card-side fix is
  needed for the "what happened" gap** — see "Deliberate scope
  narrowing" below for what IS still worth doing to cards.
- **Scoring plays throw the label away.** `last_scoring_play`
  (`poller.rs:223-228`) finds the matching detail the same way, but
  maps it through `detail_line()` (`poller.rs:166-178`) alone — which
  returns ONLY `"{athlete} {clock}"`, never touching
  `d.detail_type.text`. That field — which for a goal carries ESPN's
  own label ("Goal", "Penalty - Scored") — is read here
  (`d.detail_type` is in scope) and discarded. **This is the entire
  bug**: the data needed is already being parsed, just not kept. (Own
  goals get a different, more robust fix — see "Fixture evidence"
  below: ESPN's feed carries a structural `ownGoal` boolean, not just
  free text, and this plan derives the label from that fact directly
  rather than depending on text.)
- **Goals are `EventType::ScoreUpdate`, not `MatchState`.** The
  original filing's Scope header said "the `MatchState` → event
  title/body formatting" — that's the wrong `EventType` for the
  reported case. `diff_scoreboard` (`poller.rs:346-461`) emits goals as
  `EventType::ScoreUpdate` (`poller.rs:377`); only kickoff/half-time/
  full-time/card are `EventType::MatchState` (`poller.rs:388,398,408,425`).
  A fix aimed only at `MatchState` code would miss the actual complaint.

## Fixture evidence (this review-plan pass)

`rg -o '"text":"[^"]*"' src-tauri/tests/fixtures/*.json | sort -u`
against the five checked-in fixtures:

- `scoreboard-uefa.champions.json` contains real ESPN detail-type text:
  `"Goal"` (index 0 of the match's `details`) and `"Penalty - Scored"`
  (indices 3 and 8–14 — a penalty shootout). Both are real, unmodified
  ESPN label strings — no invented text needed for either — but the
  fixture's own scoring-play ordering means isolating the `"Goal"` case
  requires trimming the `details` list, not just diffing the fixture
  as-is; see Step 2 for the exact mechanics and why (`last_scoring_play`
  picks the *last* matching detail, which in the untouched fixture is
  a penalty, not the goal).
- **No fixture contains an own-goal or a real red card — but ESPN's raw
  feed structurally distinguishes own-goals, so this plan no longer
  needs to guess text for that case.** Reading the raw fixture JSON
  directly (`python3 -c "import json; ..."` against
  `scoreboard-uefa.champions.json`) found each scoring-play detail
  carries `"ownGoal": false` and `"penaltyKick": true/false` booleans
  alongside `"redCard"` — ESPN's own structural signal, exactly
  analogous to the `red_card` boolean `SbDetail` already parses
  (`poller.rs:92-93`). Verified: all 8 `"Penalty - Scored"` details in
  the fixture have `penaltyKick: true`; none have `ownGoal: true`
  (confirming, structurally, that this fixture indeed contains no real
  own-goal — not just that the text label is absent). **Neither
  `ownGoal` nor `penaltyKick` is currently parsed on `SbDetail`** — Step
  1 adds `own_goal: bool` (`#[serde(rename = "ownGoal", default)]`,
  same pattern as `red_card`). This lets the own-goal label be derived
  from a structural fact instead of guessed free text: when
  `d.own_goal` is true, use a fixed `"Own Goal"` label regardless of
  whatever `detail_type.text` says — deterministic, not a best-guess.
  (`penalty_kick` is available the same way but isn't needed: ESPN's
  own `detail_type.text` already reads `"Penalty - Scored"` for that
  case, confirmed directly against the fixture — parsing it is optional
  future-proofing, not required by this plan; Step 1 does not add it.)
  For red cards, `poller.rs:886-914`'s `red_card_emits_red_card_signal`
  established the precedent for synthesizing test data this way first:
  "none of the checked-in fixtures contain a real red card, so this
  synthesizes one by mutating a detail's structural booleans" — Step 2
  follows the same technique for the own-goal test, now with the same
  confidence red cards already have (a structural boolean, not text).

## Deliberate scope narrowing (this review-plan pass)

- **`EventSignal` does not change.** Every score change — goal,
  penalty, own-goal — already emits `EventSignal::Goal` unconditionally
  (`poller.rs:381`), and this plan does not add `Penalty`/`OwnGoal`
  variants (confirmed no such variants exist today —
  `event.rs:105-114` lists `Goal`/`RedCard`/`YellowCard`/`Kickoff`/
  `Halftime`/`Fulltime`/`Generic` only). The frontend's stamp lookup
  (`src/lib/presentation.ts:22-29`, `SIGNAL_STAMPS`) keys off
  `EventSignal` for a fixed generic corner-badge word ("Live" for any
  goal) — it does NOT render event-specific text, so this plan's body
  text is the only place the distinction will ever be visible, and
  leaving `EventSignal` alone is correct, not an oversight: the
  original filing's "no wire/schema change, no `SlotState` change"
  claim is confirmed true under this design.
- **The emoji prefixes (⚽/🟥) in the original filing have zero
  precedent anywhere in this codebase.** Checked: no emoji appears in
  any event body, the card labels ("Yellow Card — …"), or the
  frontend's stamp table (`presentation.ts`'s `SIGNAL_STAMPS` values
  are plain English: "Live", "Break", "Card", "Final", "Off"). This
  isn't a reason to reject emoji, but it IS a deliberate style choice
  the original filing made without checking, not an established
  convention to match. **Recommendation**: drop the emoji, match the
  existing card convention exactly (`"{Label} — {athlete} {clock}"`,
  no prefix glyph) — it's simpler, consistent with the one sibling case
  that already does this, and avoids introducing the first emoji in
  the codebase's card copy as a side effect of an unrelated bug fix. If
  the operator specifically wants the emoji, that's a one-line format-
  string change on top of Step 1 below — flag it as a question rather
  than assuming either way.

## Scope

**In scope**:
- `src-tauri/src/poller.rs`:
  - `last_scoring_play`'s construction (`poller.rs:223-228`) — change
    to capture `detail_type.text` alongside the athlete/clock line, the
    same way `last_card` already does (`poller.rs:235-247`). Extract a
    shared helper and call it from both `last_card` and
    `last_scoring_play`, so the two sites can't drift again — see
    Step 1 below for the exact helper shape (it needs one edge-case
    guard `last_card` doesn't, don't use a simpler sketch than the one
    in Step 1).
  - `MatchView`'s `last_scoring_play` field/usage
    (`poller.rs:159,223-228,263,372-375`) — the body source for the
    `ScoreUpdate` event (`poller.rs:372-383`) already reads
    `v.last_scoring_play` directly; once that field carries the label,
    no change is needed at the call site itself.
- `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` §0 — bump the `poller` count for the new
  test(s).
- Tests: extend `mod tests` in `poller.rs` (`poller.rs:629+`) —
  see "Test plan" below.

**Out of scope**:
- `last_card`'s own formatting — already correct, do not touch (see
  "Root cause" above). Do not add an emoji prefix there either, per the
  scope-narrowing recommendation, unless the operator asks for it
  explicitly for both goal and card copy together.
- Kickoff/half-time/full-time bodies (`poller.rs:390,400,410`) — plain
  `"kickoff"`/`"half-time"`/`"full-time"` strings, already
  self-describing, unaffected by this plan.
- `EventSignal`, `EventType`, any wire/schema/`SlotState` field.
- Any frontend file — `stampFor`/`presentation.ts` needs no change
  (confirmed above).
- `src-tauri/src/rss_poller.rs` and any non-ESPN producer.

## Commands you will need

| Purpose | Command | Expected on success |
|---|---|---|
| Rust suite | `cd src-tauri && cargo test --locked` | all pass; recount against `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` §0 |
| Gates | `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check` | exit 0 |

## Git workflow

- Branch: `advisor/041-espn-card-copy` (or per operator dispatch).
- Commit style (from `git log`): lowercase `area: imperative summary`,
  e.g. `poller: label scoring plays with espn's own event-type text`.
- Do NOT push or open a PR unless the operator instructed it.

## Steps

### Step 1: carry the detail-type label into scoring-play bodies

In `poller.rs`, factor the "`{kind} — {line}`, or just `{kind}` if the
line is empty" formatting `last_card` already does (`poller.rs:235-247`)
into a small shared helper, and use it for BOTH `last_card` and
`last_scoring_play` (`poller.rs:223-228`) so a goal's body becomes
e.g. `"Goal — D. Rice 3'"` or `"Penalty - Scored — H. Kane 34'"` (ESPN's
own label text passed through verbatim — do not rewrite/shorten
"Penalty - Scored" unless you're deliberately choosing to, see the
emoji note above for the same kind of judgment call). Leave `last_card`
observably unchanged (it already produces this shape) — the point of
sharing the helper is to prevent future drift between the two sites,
not to change card behavior.

**Guard the case `last_card` can't hit but `last_scoring_play` can**:
`last_card`'s search already filters on `detail_type.text.contains("Card")`,
so `kind` is guaranteed non-empty there. `last_scoring_play`'s search
(`poller.rs:226`) only filters on `d.scoring_play` — `detail_type` is
`Option<SbDetailType>` (`poller.rs:83`), so a scoring-play detail
without a type label is possible in principle, even though neither
fixture exercises it. A naive `"{kind} — {line}"` helper would produce
a stray leading `"— D. Rice 3'"` in that case — worse than today's
plain `"D. Rice 3'"`. Write the helper so an empty `kind` falls back to
just `line` (not the reverse — `line` is never empty when a detail has
an athlete):

```rust
fn labeled_detail_line(kind: &str, d: &SbDetail) -> String {
    let line = detail_line(d);
    match (kind.is_empty(), line.is_empty()) {
        (true, _) => line,
        (false, true) => kind.to_string(),
        (false, false) => format!("{kind} — {line}"),
    }
}
```

**Add the `own_goal` structural field and derive the own-goal label from
it, not from text.** In `SbDetail` (`poller.rs:81-98`), add a field
right alongside `red_card` — same rename pattern, same rationale:

```rust
// structural own-goal signal, exactly like `red_card` above — read
// directly instead of guessing at whatever free-text label ESPN uses
// for an own goal (unverified; no checked-in fixture has one).
#[serde(rename = "ownGoal", default)]
pub own_goal: bool,
```

Then in `last_scoring_play`'s construction (`poller.rs:223-228`),
compute `kind` as: `"Own Goal"` when `d.own_goal` is true, else
`d.detail_type.as_ref().map(|t| t.text.clone()).unwrap_or_default()`
(ESPN's own label, verbatim, for every other case — `"Goal"`,
`"Penalty - Scored"`, or anything ESPN adds later) — THEN pass that
`kind` into `labeled_detail_line`. `own_goal` is checked FIRST and
short-circuits the text lookup entirely, so the own-goal case never
depends on knowing ESPN's real own-goal text string. Do not add a
`penalty_kick` field — it exists on the raw feed the same way, but
isn't needed: `detail_type.text` already reads `"Penalty - Scored"` for
that case (confirmed against the fixture), so parsing the boolean too
would be redundant, not more correct.

**Verify**: `cargo build --locked` (from `src-tauri/`) → exit 0.

### Step 2: tests

Add to `poller.rs`'s `mod tests` (`poller.rs:629+`). **Read this whole
step before writing any test** — the UCL fixture's own match is already
`post`/final on first sighting (confirmed by the existing
`first_sighting_is_silent_and_final_matches_are_not_tracked` test,
`poller.rs:717-723`: `baseline(UCL)` returns an EMPTY snapshot for this
reason), so `baseline(UCL)` cannot be used as a starting point the way
`baseline(USA)` is used elsewhere — diffing against an empty snapshot
takes the `None` branch in `diff_scoreboard`'s match (`poller.rs:360-367`)
and emits nothing at all. The two existing UCL-fixture tests
(`new_card_emits_match_state_with_detail`, `poller.rs:865-884`, and
`red_card_emits_red_card_signal`, `poller.rs:886-914`) both work around
this the same way: hand-build a synthetic `prev: Snapshot` from
`view(&sb.events[0]).snap` with `state` forced to `"in"` (and whatever
field needs decrementing so the diff detects a change), then diff a
separately-parsed `live` copy (also `state` forced to `"in"`) against
it. Follow that exact pattern here, not `baseline`.

**Also read this before writing test 1**: the UCL fixture's `details`
array has scoring-play entries at multiple indices — index 0 is
`"Goal"`, and indices 3 and 8–14 are all `"Penalty - Scored"` (a
penalty shootout — verified by reading the fixture directly).
`last_scoring_play` (`poller.rs:223-228`) is
`details.iter().rev().find(|d| d.scoring_play)` — the LAST matching
entry in array order wins. **Diffing the untouched fixture yields
`"Penalty - Scored"`, not `"Goal"`** — the reverse of what you might
expect from "the fixture has a Goal detail." Test 2 (Penalty) can use
the fixture as-is; test 1 (Goal) must truncate `details` down to just
the index-0 entry first, or `.rev().find()` will still land on a later
penalty.

1. **Goal** — isolate the one `"Goal"` detail:
   ```rust
   let sb = parse_scoreboard(UCL).unwrap();
   let mut v_snap = view(&sb.events[0]).snap;
   v_snap.state = "in".to_string();
   v_snap.home_score -= 1; // "one goal ago"
   let mut snap = Snapshot::new();
   snap.insert(sb.events[0].id.clone(), v_snap);

   let mut live = parse_scoreboard(UCL).unwrap();
   live.events[0].status.status_type.state = "in".to_string();
   live.events[0].competitions[0].details.truncate(1); // keep only the "Goal" entry (index 0)

   let (events, _) = diff_scoreboard(&snap, &live, 8, "uefa.champions", Priority::High);
   assert_eq!(events.len(), 1);
   assert!(matches!(events[0].event_type, EventType::ScoreUpdate));
   assert!(events[0].payload.body.starts_with("Goal — "));
   ```
   (`home_score` here is PSG's, per the fixture — either team's score
   works for triggering the diff; the specific team doesn't matter for
   this test.)
2. **Penalty** — same shape, but do NOT truncate `details` (the last
   scoring-play entry in the untouched fixture already IS
   `"Penalty - Scored"`, so this is what you get for free):
   ```rust
   let sb = parse_scoreboard(UCL).unwrap();
   let mut v_snap = view(&sb.events[0]).snap;
   v_snap.state = "in".to_string();
   v_snap.home_score -= 1;
   let mut snap = Snapshot::new();
   snap.insert(sb.events[0].id.clone(), v_snap);

   let mut live = parse_scoreboard(UCL).unwrap();
   live.events[0].status.status_type.state = "in".to_string();

   let (events, _) = diff_scoreboard(&snap, &live, 8, "uefa.champions", Priority::High);
   assert_eq!(events.len(), 1);
   assert!(events[0].payload.body.starts_with("Penalty - Scored — "));
   ```
3. **Own goal** — synthesized (no fixture has one), following
   `red_card_emits_red_card_signal`'s exact technique of mutating one
   detail's structural fields by hand: same `prev`-construction as
   above, then on `live`, pick `details.last_mut()` (or any single
   entry — index doesn't matter once you're overwriting it) and set
   `scoring_play = true` and `own_goal = true` (the new field from
   Step 1). **Do NOT set `detail_type.text`** — the whole point of
   deriving the label from `own_goal` structurally is that the text
   field is irrelevant for this case; leave it as whatever the fixture
   already has, to prove the label truly comes from the boolean, not
   from text that happens to still be lying around from a copy-paste.
   The expected body is `"Own Goal — {athlete} {clock}"`, a fixed
   string this plan controls directly — no guessing, no ESPN-text
   dependency.
   ```rust
   let sb = parse_scoreboard(UCL).unwrap();
   let mut v_snap = view(&sb.events[0]).snap;
   v_snap.state = "in".to_string();
   v_snap.home_score -= 1;
   let mut snap = Snapshot::new();
   snap.insert(sb.events[0].id.clone(), v_snap);

   let mut live = parse_scoreboard(UCL).unwrap();
   live.events[0].status.status_type.state = "in".to_string();
   let last_detail = live.events[0].competitions[0]
       .details
       .last_mut()
       .expect("fixture has at least one detail");
   last_detail.scoring_play = true;
   last_detail.own_goal = true;

   let (events, _) = diff_scoreboard(&snap, &live, 8, "uefa.champions", Priority::High);
   assert_eq!(events.len(), 1);
   assert!(events[0].payload.body.starts_with("Own Goal — "));
   ```

**Verify**: `cargo test --locked poller::` → all pass, including the
three new cases; `cargo test --locked` (full) → all pass, totals match
the updated `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` §0.

### Step 3: docs + status

Bump `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` §0's `poller` count. Flip this plan's
`plans/README.md` row to DONE.

**Verify**: `cargo test --locked 2>&1 | grep "test result"` totals
match §0 exactly.

## Test plan

- New: the three cases in Step 2 (real-fixture goal, real-fixture
  penalty, synthesized own-goal).
- Unchanged: every existing card/kickoff/half-time/full-time test
  (`last_card`'s shape doesn't move) and `red_card_emits_red_card_signal`
  itself (the shared helper this plan introduces must produce the same
  output for that test's inputs — if it doesn't, the refactor changed
  card behavior by accident, which is out of scope). Specifically watch
  `score_delta_emits_one_score_update_and_nothing_for_unchanged`
  (`poller.rs:767-777`): it asserts `body == "goal"` (lowercase, the
  `diff_scoreboard`-level fallback for when the USA fixture's feed has
  no scoring-play detail at all, so `last_scoring_play` is `None`) —
  this plan's change only affects what `last_scoring_play` contains
  when a detail IS found; the `None` fallback path and its exact string
  are untouched. This test failing is the clearest signal the fallback
  path was accidentally touched.

## Done criteria

- [ ] `cd src-tauri && cargo test --locked` exits 0; totals match §0
- [ ] `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check` exit 0
- [ ] A goal event's body contains ESPN's own scoring-play label
      (`"Goal"`/`"Penalty - Scored"`/etc.), not just `"{athlete} {clock}"`
- [ ] `last_card`'s existing tests are unchanged and still pass (the
      shared-helper refactor is behavior-preserving for cards)
- [ ] No `EventSignal`, `EventType`, or `SlotState` field changed —
      `git diff -- src-tauri/src/event.rs` is empty
- [ ] `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` §0 updated
- [ ] `plans/README.md` status row updated

## STOP conditions

(Note: the own-goal label is deliberately NOT a STOP condition or a
guess — Step 1 derives it from ESPN's structural `ownGoal` boolean, not
from text, so there is nothing to verify externally.)

- `poller.rs` dirty in the working tree at start → STOP and coordinate.
- The shared-helper refactor changes `red_card_emits_red_card_signal`'s
  or any other existing card test's expected output → STOP; that means
  the refactor isn't behavior-preserving for cards and needs rethinking,
  not a test-value update (the point of sharing the helper is that
  cards don't change).

## Maintenance notes

- ESPN's own `detail_type.text` is now the source of truth for
  scoring-play labels, matching how cards already work — a future new
  ESPN play-type label (if ESPN ever adds one) will "just work" without
  a code change, since nothing here matches on a closed set of known
  strings. If a future card wants a closed-set classification instead
  (e.g. to drive a new `EventSignal` variant), that's a bigger, separate
  change — this plan deliberately doesn't do that (see "Deliberate
  scope narrowing").
- If 039 lands after this plan, its `make_event`/`diff_scoreboard`
  signature changes (adding `topic`/rotation args) are orthogonal to
  the `body` string this plan touches — expect a clean textual merge,
  not a semantic conflict.
